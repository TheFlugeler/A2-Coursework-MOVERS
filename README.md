# A2 Software Systems Development Coursework
## MOVERS Booking System

This is my submission for the coursework section of A2 SSD.
It is a Windows Forms Project using an SQL Database.
The purpose is to enable MOVERS office staff to improve the efficiency of their work.
It allows the storing of customer details and creating records for moval jobs and inspections.
It also has a staff login using hashing for better password security.
